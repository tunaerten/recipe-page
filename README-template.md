### What I learned

It took longer than I expected. I saw that the project had a lot of details. The Figma file was really helpful. At first, I didn't use flexbox or grid to build the project. After finishing the project and starting to set up media queries, I noticed that when the page began to shrink, it caused many small problems. Therefore, I went back to the beginning and redesigned the page with a grid. This time, I got the result I wanted. In my next project, I will definitely consider this from the start. For the first time in CSS, I used the (:not) operator. I had seen it a few times but had never used it before. Additionally, I used table for the first time. I frequently referred to MDN pages to recall what I had learned.Other than that, it was a very enjoyable project. I am eagerly looking forward to the next project.
